TMDB - Data Analysis
The data set contains observation of about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. You can find more about the dataset here. In this project, I'm going to investigate the dataset to find out the movies with highest profits, hits and other interesting stuff about movies from the data.
